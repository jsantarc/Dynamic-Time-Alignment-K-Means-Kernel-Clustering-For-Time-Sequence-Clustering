# Dynamic-Time-Alignment-K-Means-Kernel-Clustering-For-Time-Sequence-Clustering
This is a matlab implementation of Dynamic Time-Alignment (DTA) K-Means Kernel Clustering For Time Sequence Clustering. The code is similar to what I used in my paper [1]. The code first calculates the DTA Kernel matrix, then performs clustering on time series of different lengths.
